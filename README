Simple Migrations v1.0
===============================================================================

"Simple Migrations" ideally should keep the migration process simple and not
try to do too many things for you. I don't think that it's too much to ask that
you know how to write SQL or be able to do data manipulation. I try to use
as much of Django's builtins as possible to avoid any issues across databases
but just to be clear my main purpose right now is to get it to work with 
PostgreSQL, any compatibility with other databases at this point is purely
coincidental.

===============================================================================
Install
===============================================================================

1) Copy the simplemigrations directory in to your python path.
In Debian this is in /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/simplemigrations.

I'll eventually get around to making using setuptools or something else to
make this bit easier.

2) Add 'simplemigrations' to your INSTALLED_APPS in your Django project's 
settings.py file.

3) Create a directory in your Django project and set MIGRATION_DIRECTORY to it
in your settings.py file.

i.e. MIGRATION_DIRECTORY = '/myproject/schemachanges'

4) Create the database table for simplemigrations.  You can do this by just
running:

	./manage.py syncdb
	
or manually creating the table schema generated from:

	./manage.py sqlall simplemigrations


===============================================================================
Usage
===============================================================================

You can see the list of commands available by running:

	./manage.py migration


Currently the list of commands are:

	./manage.py migration create [name] # Create new migration
	./manage.py migration run           # Run migrations
	./manage.py migration redo          # Redo last migration
	./manage.py migration undo          # Undo last migration
